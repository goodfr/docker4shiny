## Purpose

## How to pull the image

```{Docker, eval = FALSE}
FROM project021018/shiny_r51:1.0

# === get additional needed packages
# RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('shinycssloader')"
```

The following packages have been isntalled : `DBI`, `odbc`, `data.table`, `dplyr`, `httr`, `ggplot2`, `rstudioapi`, `gridExtra`, `tidyr`, `shinycssloader`.
